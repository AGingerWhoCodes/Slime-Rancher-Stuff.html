<h6>My Ideas For New Slimes</h6>
<p>Sand Slime: Like a Pink Slime, but it's a sandy colour. It would eat everything, with it's favourite food being a new food: a Sand Berry. You would find Sand Berrys on a tree which looks like balls of sand.<br><br>
Bear Slime (My brothers idea): Like a Tabby Slime, but it's brown, has a bear face, and small ears. It would eat meat, with it's favourite food being a new type of hen: a Roasted Hen. It's just a brown hen.</p>
